# Home Listener
This project runs on my personal laptop. It uses open source software to manage, automate, and visualize my personal data and software projects. It uses MySQL, R, Python and Github Pages. Next on the list is setting up open source ETL so I can create jobs that already have some structure in place (logging, wrappers, begin/end scripts). Not quite sure of the end vision yet, but I plan to use a super basic iOS app to push trigger files to a listener on my home device.

## Motivation
This project is to help me manage all the data in my life with as much ease as possible. About my use specifically: I work on the Marketing Operations Team in the Marketing Department at Williams Sonoma. I sit between marketing stakeholders and tech-savvy developers to communicate requirements and priorities. I am passionate about organization and robust processes. This project is the interface I will use for all of my digital/programmatic/data/machine learning assets, in combination with Trello, to help manage and measure my life priorities!
